          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>
              In this project, I worked collaboratively with a team to design and implement a comprehensive relational database system 
              focused on DMV public figures. We captured detailed information about demographics, career histories, social media presence, 
              and educational backgrounds. Together, we used advanced SQL techniques including complex joins, aggregations, and view creation 
              to build a dynamic and scalable data model that integrates diverse datasets into actionable insights.<br />
                        
            <br />
              We developed multiple SQL views to simplify data retrieval and enable efficient analysis of occupation trends, social media 
              influence, and demographic patterns within the DMV region. Our cooperative approach ensured data integrity, optimized query 
              performance, and delivered a robust schema capable of supporting complex analytical queries with precision.<br />

              <br />
              Throughout the project, we engaged in continuous peer review and collaborative problem-solving to refine our design, improve code 
              quality, and follow best practices. This resulted in a high-quality database solution suited for deep data exploration.
